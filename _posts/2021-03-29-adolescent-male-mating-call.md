title: "Adolescent Male Mating Call"
---

Any of y'all up to date on this latest [high pitched
"sheeeeeeesh"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbhoGV5XnvE) nonsense on Tik Tok?
This noise infuriates me. As far as I can tell, it's a sort of adolescent male
mating call (not sure I understand why there are girls trying to "be cool like
the homies" with this asinine sound effect). It's an adolescent male move that's
about as obnoxious and brain-dead and intended for maximally confusing or
offending saliency as every other adolescent male "move" that exists out there
(examples being the "a is car b is truck what is c" game or talking very loudly
and frequently about sex [e.g. what is long and hard and full of seamen or
writing pen15 everywhere because it looks like penis] or sticking their hands up
their shirts all the time to feel their abs or that move where a group of them
will stand up extra straight and pretend to look decent for a moment while a
woman walks by and then collapse into jeering and pointed laughter or
"bod-admiring" amongst themselves once she's past them).

What bothers me the most about this behavior is the lifetime socialization and
acceptance for men to behave in this perpetually puerile and inconsiderate
manner. Think "boys will be boys" to justify boys being socially incompetent or
physically destructive or inconsiderate of others (I won't discuss it here but
consider the double standard for how girls are expected to behave at the age
where this phrase is most commonly used). Think "dad jokes" for men to get away
with making stupid (真的很難笑) jokes and for creating the expectation that
groaning and rolling your eyes in response is a positive response to: "What do
you call a factory that makes okay products?" "A satisfactory."

I'm fed up with the margin to be socially accepted even while behaving like

if not worse (stepping over other's [esp. women's] boundaries for
entertainment's sake [一切都是為了取樂...開玩笑而已你別往心力去幹嘛這麼ㄍㄧㄣ?
你連幽默感都沒有嗎？]) that (mainly white) men are given. What could this kind
of constant apologetic, servile, sycophantic back bending in service of the
(white) male deliver except
